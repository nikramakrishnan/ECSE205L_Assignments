## Why Software Engineering not manufacturing?

  Although there are a few similarities between developing
  software and manufacturing, there exists a fundamental
  difference between them.
  - Software is not "manufactured"

    Software is not "manufactured" in the classical sense. It is engineered. The process of manufacturing can add quality problems, but such problems can be easily corrected for software. The workforce in manufacturing is focused more on the production of a pre-designed, thoroughly tested product, while building software requires the workforce to focus more on "building" and "engineering" the product.

  - Design is everything

    In software development, the design phase is practically everything. In manufacturing, the production (assembly line) takes up most of the resources, while production in software engineering is only a matter of copying files. Simply put, the product design is the product in software.

  - Software does not "wear out"

    Software, like manufactured goods, does not wear out, or fail. In manufacturing, the failure rate, high at the beginning, stabilizes to a constant, and then increases as the product starts failing, due to external factors. This is depicted by the classical "bathtub curve." Software does not "wear out", as it is not affected by external factors like environment, but it does deteriorate gradually due to addition of more features, which brings along errors and bugs.

## Why do so many software development projects fail?

  Software projects do not fail or succeed because of a specific feature, but on whether they fulfil the requirements of the client. Projects usually fail due to problems in the feasibility evaluation phase.

  There is a disconnect between the people who deal with facts(programmers) and the people who deal with other people (sales/marketing).  
  For the programmers, facts are to be dealt with, but for a sales person, facts are the opinions of other people, and those can change over time.

  To bridge this difference between the client requirements and the facts that a programmer needs to build software, a manager who can understand software development and developers, and can deal well with other aspects such as clients and sales is required. Such projects will generally succeed.

## What are the three most important reasons that many software development projects fail? Justify why these are the most important reasons.

  - Unrealistic project goals

    The desire to please stakeholders and bosses can lead to overly ambitious project goals, milestones and scheduling. This can lead to a variety of problems.

    Having unrealistic goals can directly affect the working of an organization, in the form of large increase in the number of employees, or a working schedule that is too stressful for everyone working on the project.

    The results of this are often the same - Team members under constant stress, trying to cope up with the practically impossible schedule. With increasing stress and tension, it is even less likely that the project will be completed on time.

  - Inaccurate estimate of required resources

    Estimates by managers that lack feasibility study and other calculations can have a major impact on the progress of development. Some of the resources and how they affect development:

     1. Time: Estimation of milestones/completion by a non-developer can lead to a variety of problems as stated above.
     2. Human Resources: Incorrect estimation of the human resources required can negatively affect the development. Having too few can affect the schedule of the project, extending timelines. It also adds to the workload of every employee. Similarly, having too many can create a lot of confusion and disconnect between teams, individuals and the customer.


  - Poor communication among customers, developers,
  and users

    This can be disastrous for a project. Poor communication with customers can lead to an incorrect interpretation of the requirements, which means that the project has failed already, before development.

    The perception among developers, that software is delivered on time when most time is spent writing code, may actually be a reason that projects fail. Meetings do take up a lot of time. However, to build a great application, developers must spend time talking, to understand the requirements and expectations from a software.

## Why is change inevitable in successful software products?

 Successful software will evolve over time. Newer technology brings more efficient ways to write, manage, test and document code. This can also improve the efficiency and reduce the memory consumption. To retain the user base, both for large corporations and small companies, it is essential to adopt newer technologies. Change includes fixing bugs, adding features, or re-writing old code.

 Fixing bugs is the first priority, as this is to make sure the customer/users face no problems while using the already delivered software.

 Adding features is a must, to keep up with the changing requirements of the customer and the highly competitive nature of the industry.

 Rewriting code is considered important when code bases become old and inefficient, or when the old code is not scalable, in cases where the user base increases exponentially.

 As an example, in January 2017, Duolingo, an online service to learn languages for free, refactored code from Python to Scala (<http://making.duolingo.com/rewriting-duolingos-engine-in-scala>). As a result:
  - Latency dropped from 750ms to 14ms
  - Engine uptime increased from 99.9% to 100%

 This means faster website and apps, more uptime, and less server load. All this improves user satisfaction, making it a "successful" software, as a result of change and evolution.

## How understanding of Software Engineering concepts helps you as student/developer?

 Having knowledge of Software engineering as a student will help to manage my projects effectively and efficiently. Selecting a development model and following it will ensure the process is smooth, and also provide an experience of how the actual software industry works.

 As a developer, software development highlights the importance of understanding the requirements, talking to the customer, and test code. Most of the projects that are initially made by developers (when not working for a company) are not thoroughly tested, and do not meet the actual requirements. Software engineering focuses on these issues, and a developer who applies these concepts understands the facts, develops software accordingly, and performs unit tests to ensure that the software requirements are met and the software is successful.
