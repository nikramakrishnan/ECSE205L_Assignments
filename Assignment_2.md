## Why is a sequential development easier to manage than an iterative development? Justify your answer.

  In Sequential approach, development is done in a set of steps that goes from start to finish in a linear path of progression.

  Sequential development is done in steps in terms of design, implementation, testing and maintenance. These are often broken down into sub-steps, but most sequential methods follow the same pattern. A traditional example of sequential development is the Waterfall Model.

  The iterative approach does not have a set number of linear steps, rather, development is done in cycles.

  Iterative development approach is less concerned about tracking the progress of individual features, rather it focuses on building a working prototype first, and then adding features in cycles, with each cycle having most steps of the incremental/sequential models.

  It is easier to manage sequential development because in this approach, the initial steps such as requirements elicitation and risk analysis has to be done only once. After this is done, the development process can start, and once a feature/module is completed, there is no need to look back except for maintenance. This makes the flow of the process linear and easy to manage.

  In iterative approach, all the steps from collecting requirements to analyzing risk must be repeated in each cycle of development. This calls for continuous interaction with the customer/user and due to this, requirements might change, and unclear communication could cause further problems, if not properly analyzed. This may end up being “overwhelming” for managers.

## Is the Spiral Model of Software Development an iterative, incremental, or sequential model? Explain and justify your answer.

  The spiral model is an iterative based model, with increments built into each of the iterations. It combines the principles of the iterative development process model, and sequential linear development model to provide a systematic, controlled approach to software development.

  Along with being a systematic process, like the waterfall model, it allows incremental releases and refinement of the product through each iteration around the spiral.

  A very important feature of the model is that it is risk-driven. This means that risk analysis is conducted in each iteration of the model. This makes the model fit for usage in medium to high risk projects.

  There are four phases in the spiral model, through which a project repeatedly passes, on each iteration of the model – spirals.

  Thus, spiral model comes under a category of development models called the Iterative and incremental development approach (IID), which is a combination of both approaches.

## Why is extreme programming an adaptive methodology?

  Extreme programming is a software development methodology that aims to improve software responsiveness and quality to changing customer requirements. It is a type of “agile” methodology, which, in software development, is defined as the ability to respond to changes. These changes can be in the form of requirements, technology or people.

  Extreme programming is developed fundamentally to incorporate and accept changes as a part of the development process. Being an “agile” process, it relies on fast releases in short development cycles. This greatly increases productivity, and creates “checkpoints” for adopting changes.

  Extreme programming advocates writing test cases before the actual coding. Extensive testing ensures that changes, if and when required, do not break the software or any of its components.

  For example, if in any one of the meetings during an iteration, it is found that the customer requirements have changed, the team should embrace that change, and plan the new requirements for the next iteration.
  A working system in this model always ensures that there is enough time to accommodate these changes without affecting the current operation of the system.

## Which SDLC model will you use while developing a simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) and while developing a word processor (like Microsoft Word 2017). Justify your answer.

  Calculator:
  - For a calculator, I would prefer to use the Waterfall model.
  - This is a traditional sequential design process, in which the processes flow downward like a waterfall, through different phases.
  - This model is preferred because the requirements are very well known for a calculator.
  - Once we are done with a phase, there is no need to go back. Requirements are met, and testing is not very difficult.
  - Project visibility is high, and it is easy to manage.
  - We do not need a very flexible product, as the functions for a calculator are fixed.

  Word Processor:
  - I would choose the incremental model to develop a word processor.
  - The incremental model combines elements of the waterfall model combined with iterations.
  -	With this method, the core functions are completed in the first few iterations, allowing for more features to be added in later iterations.
  -	Each iteration adds planned features, and then the next iteration is planned. In this way, the development progresses as planned, and sticks to a schedule, if required.
  -	This process is repeated until the product is completed, and is ready for release.
  -	For example: Adding a simple textbox, and formatting options first, then adding more features such as references, footnotes, templates etc.

## Why the waterfall model is practically not feasible to use in today’s world of rapid changing business?

  One of the earliest methods of software development, the waterfall model is easy to understand and implement because the phases in this model progress sequentially downwards, like a waterfall. Once a phase of the model is completed, there is no way to go back to it and change it/make corrections.

  This is the main reason that the waterfall model is not feasible to use in today’s world. Nowadays, everything is fast-changing, and this also includes customer requirements. Owing to change in user demands, environment, and many other factors, it is extremely likely that the requirements of a customer will change multiple times during the development of a software.

  While the waterfall model might be easy to understand and implement, it does not fit well with changing requirements, that require models such as Agile, Spiral, RAD, Incremental etc.

  Among the many other disadvantages, there is also no way to keep track or progress within the stages of development. Customers today expect frequent status reports of the project, and the waterfall model provides no such feature. On the other hand, the iterative and agile models have continuous status checks and interaction with the customer to stay informed of any change in requirements.

  **tl;dr** – Unless developing something well known like a calculator, it is best to stay away from the waterfall model, and use something of a more iterative nature.
